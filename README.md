## Challenge
Create an Orrery Web App that Displays Near-Earth Objects

## About the Challenge
Since a mechanical model of the solar system was presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713, such models have been referred to as orreries. The first orreries were physical models, but today we can use numerous tools to create virtual orreries that have many more features than their ancient mechanical counterparts. Your challenge is to create an interactive orrery web app that is embedded in a webpage and displays celestial bodies such as planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.

## High-level Summary
We developed Cosmic Converse, an interactive web application designed to educate users about the solar system through immersive, AI-powered conversations with celestial objects. By presenting a visually engaging solar system model, users can explore planets, moons, and near-Earth objects, each accompanied by informative details. A unique feature allows users to "chat" with these celestial bodies, as if they were speaking in a first-person narrative. The chat memory is preserved, enabling continuous interaction. Cosmic Converse addresses the challenge of making space exploration more interactive and accessible by merging education with engaging, AI-driven dialogue. This approach fosters curiosity and learning in a fun, memorable way, making it especially valuable for those interested in astronomy and casual learners alike. The combination of visual elements, real-time conversations, and educational content enhances user engagement and makes space exploration more relatable.

## Project Details
Cosmic Converse is an interactive web application that allows users to explore the solar system in an engaging and educational manner. It combines visual representations of celestial objects with a unique AI-powered chat system, enabling users to converse with planets, moons, and near-Earth objects in a first-person narrative. Here’s how the project works, its benefits, and the tools we used to develop it:

## What exactly does Cosmic Converse do?
### Interactive Solar System Exploration:
The web application presents a dynamic, visual model of the solar system, where users can freely navigate and explore various celestial bodies, including planets, asteroids, moons, and near-Earth objects.
By clicking on any object, users can view important information and facts, providing a quick educational overview.
### AI-Powered First-Person Chat:
One of the unique features of Cosmic Converse is the ability for users to chat with celestial objects. When a user selects an object and clicks on the chat option, they can engage in an interactive conversation.
The celestial object responds in a first-person narrative, giving it a “voice” and a personality. This creates a more immersive and fun learning experience.
### Preserved Chat Memory:
The application preserves the chat history, enabling continuous conversations with the selected object. This means users can return to previous conversations without losing context, enhancing engagement and the learning process.
### AI Conversations Powered by Google Gemini Flash 1.5:
The conversational aspect of the application is driven by the Google Gemini Flash 1.5 API, ensuring smooth, responsive, and coherent dialogue between the user and the celestial objects.

## How does it work?
### Frontend:
The user interface is built using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework. It provides a responsive and smooth user experience, enabling users to explore the solar system with ease and interact seamlessly with the chat feature.
### Backend:
The backend is developed using Node.js, which manages data flow, chat memory preservation, and interaction between the frontend and the AI API.
### AI Integration:
Google Gemini Flash 1.5 API powers the conversational system, ensuring that celestial objects respond intelligently to user queries in real-time. The AI provides meaningful, context-aware responses to make the interaction feel natural and informative.
### Data Handling:
The application uses various open data sources to provide accurate information about celestial bodies. The information presented about each object is curated from open references on the internet.

## Benefits of Cosmic Converse
### Interactive Learning Experience:
Users can actively explore and learn about celestial objects through direct interaction, which enhances engagement and retention of information.
### Engaging Conversations:
The ability to "chat" with planets and other objects makes the learning process more fun and memorable, especially for younger audiences and astronomy enthusiasts.
### Personalized Exploration:
Users have the flexibility to explore the solar system at their own pace, selecting the objects that interest them and engaging in conversations to learn more in-depth information.
### Continuous Conversations:
The preservation of chat history enables users to continue previous conversations, allowing them to build on their learning over time without starting over.

## What do we hope to achieve?
Our goal with Cosmic Converse is to create a platform that makes learning about space more accessible, engaging, and enjoyable for users of all ages. By merging visual exploration with AI-powered conversations, we aim to foster a deeper understanding of the solar system in an interactive way. The project is designed to appeal to anyone with an interest in space, from students to casual learners, helping them gain knowledge while having fun.

## Tools, Coding Languages & Software used
### Frontend Framework:
Vue.js: A JavaScript framework used to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
### Backend Framework:
Node.js: A runtime environment for building fast, scalable server-side applications. It manages the communication between the frontend and the chat system.
### AI API:
Google Gemini Flash 1.5 API: This AI API is integrated to power the conversational capabilities of the application, ensuring fluid and context-aware interactions with celestial objects.
### Additional Tools:
- Open Web Resources: We referenced multiple open-access websites to gather accurate information about the solar system and its celestial bodies.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Core web technologies were used to structure and style the application’s interface.

## Conclusion
Cosmic Converse is an innovative web application designed to change the way people learn about the solar system. Through visual exploration and engaging, AI-driven conversations with celestial bodies, users are able to gain a deeper understanding of space in a fun and interactive way. The combination of modern web development tools and AI technology makes this project both educational and entertaining, providing a unique learning experience for space enthusiasts and learners of all ages.

## Use of Artificial Intelligence
Yes, we utilized Google Gemini Flash 1.5 API as the primary AI tool in the development of Cosmic Converse. This AI-powered API was integrated into our chat system to provide smooth, real-time conversational responses between the users and the celestial objects in the solar system. Here’s how we used it:
- Conversational AI: The API enabled the objects (planets, moons, near-Earth objects) to respond intelligently and coherently to user inputs. These interactions were crafted to feel natural, with the celestial objects adopting a first-person narrative style.
- Context Preservation: The AI helps maintain the context of the conversation, allowing for seamless, continuous interaction without losing any chat history. This contributes to a more engaging user experience.
The integration of AI was pivotal in making the conversation feature dynamic, responsive, and educational, enhancing the overall interactivity of the project.
